The Social Tenure Domain Model (STDM) is a propoor land information tool that provides a flexible approach for representing people-land relationships. The tool provides a practical approach for representing these relationships independent of the level of formality, legality and technical accuracy.

Some of the functionality provided by the tool include:

-   It enables the design of new or extension of existing data configurations using an intuitive configuration wizard;

-   It allows for the definition of custom, application-wide, hierarchies of administrative units;

-   It supports the design of custom templates for map-based documents/reports;

-   It enables the generation of map-based documents in batch using custom templates;

-   It provides intuitive import and export wizards that support both textual and spatial data in different formats.

###Third Party Software

STDM is built on top of free and open source geospatial software products. The client has been developed as a QGIS Python plugin, whereas the backend is based on a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database stack. These are required prior to using STDM.

###Installation

STDM can be installed in two ways:

1.  For beginners - using the all-in-one installer which can be downloaded from [the STDM website](http://www.stdm.gltn.net/downloads/). This will install PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS (with the STDM plugin embedded), and copy sample data (optional).

2.  For advanced users – using the QGIS plugin manager:

    1.  In QGIS Desktop, go to menu **“Plugins -&gt; Manage and Install Plugins…”** On the **“Plugins”** dialog, select **“Settings”** tab.

    2.  Click **“Add…”** to open repository details dialog. The dialog allows you to enter STDM repository properties, enter the details as shown below:

        -   In the **Name** field enter: GLTN Plugin Repository

        -   In the **URL** field enter: <http://stdm.gltn.net/plugin/plugins.xml>

    3.  Check the **“Enabled”** option then select **“OK”** to close.

    4.  The GLTN repository entry should now be visible on the **“Plugin repositories”** list.

    5.  While still on the **“Plugins”** window, select **“Not installed”** tab, then scroll down and look for **“Social Tenure Domain Model”** on the list of **“Not installed”** plugins. Select it and click **“Install plugin”.**

    6.  QGIS will download and install the STDM plugin. The plugin should now be available on the **“Installed”** page and also on the QGIS toolbar and main menu respectively.

    7.  Now you are ready to start using STDM.

    > This option will require that PostgreSQL and PostGIS be installed beforehand. In addition, an empty spatially-enabled database needs to have been created prior to using STDM.
    >
    > **Note:** If you have issues when downloading the plugin, first confirm if the network settings are okay. On the QGIS menu go to **“Settings -&gt; Options”** In the **“Options”** dialog box select **“Network”** tab and check your proxy settings are okay. For more details on setting up network options, please read the QGIS documentation available [here](http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/user_manual/).
