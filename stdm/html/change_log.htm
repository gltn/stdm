<h1>What's New in STDM Version 1.7?</h1>
<p>STDM 1.7 is a full release which includes new exciting features as well
 as enhanced functionality and stability of existing features. One of the
 key highlights is the integration with GeoODK where STDM data profiles
 can be directly exported to ODK XForms specification. Other changes include
 additional options for customizing a data profileâ€™s social tenure relationship;
 the ability to change the order of<strong>&#160;Entities</strong>&#160;and
 <strong>Columns</strong>; better integration with QGIS Attribute Table
 and styling, major bug fixes to the <strong>Documents Designer</strong>;
 inclusion of document template samples for the three sample STDM profiles;
 minor enhancements and bug fixes throughout the system. In addition, the
 user interface has been translated to French, Portuguese, Arabic and German.
 </p>
<p>We would like to thank our partners and everyone else who supported
 the development, documentation, testing and translation of the tool. In
 a special way, we would like to acknowledge: </p>

</ul>
<p>The following sections summarize the new features in STDM 1.7. </p>
<h1>Mobile Integration</h1>
<p>Mobile data collection is supported as a new feature in this release.
 GeoODK, ODK and Kobo Collect application can now be used for data collection
 with forms generated from STDM data model (profile). This generated form
 conforms to the ODK standard and XFORM syntax supporting a wide collection
 of attributes such text, pictures, geographic data, list, numbers, barcodes
 e.tc. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image9.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>A <strong>Generate Mobile Form</strong>&#160;feature provides an interface
 for converting the current STDM profile into a mobile data collection
 form for use in Android based mobile phones and tablets. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" title="" style="max-width: 410.50px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the collected data can be imported into STDM using mobile
 data import wizard in a simple interface (shown below) that pulls data
 from mobile device into the STDM database. </p>
<p><img src="import instance dialog.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0" />
 </p>
<p>Mobile support enhances the power of STDM creating a shift from pen
 and paper data collection so that data can be electronically collected
 using mobile devices and transferred into STDM in a simple user friendly
 interface. The mobile applications are freely available from Google Play.
 The user will only need to create STDM profile then generate the corresponding
 mobile form. Once generated, the form can be uploaded to mobile via USB
 cable to the application folder in the mobile device or fetched from an
 ODK aggregate server hosted within the network. </p>
<h1>Database Configuration</h1>
<h2>Entity Label</h2>
<p>Entities can now have customized labels. The labels can be more descriptive
 and user friendly than the entity names. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image14.png" title="" style="max-width: 617.00px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>Entities and Column Ordering </h2>
<p>With STDM 1.7 it is now possible to change the order of created entities
 and columns by simply dragging and dropping the items in the configuration
 wizard. The order for entities will be reflected on the STDM menu, while
 the columns order will be reflected in the data entry forms. </p>
<h2>&#160;Column Label </h2>
<p>Labeling of columns on a form is now easily customizable. You can now
 choose which label will appear next to a column field on a generated form.
 Normally, a label of a column is auto-generated from the value entered
 in&#160;Column Name&#160;field when creating columns. &#160;Now, with
 version 1.7, a new field called &#160;in the column editor allows you
 to change that behavior by letting you enter a value that will be used
 as a column label on the auto-generated form, see image below. </p>

<h2>Defining Social Tenure Relationship </h2>
<h3>Multiple Spatial Units </h3>
<p>Defining Social Tenure Relationship in the configuration wizard now
 has been improved to allow multiple spatial units for a single party or
 multiple parties. Prior to this, it was only possible to have a single
 spatial unit participating in a social tenure relationship. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image16.png" title="" style="max-width: 624.00px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>Tenure Type of Spatial Units</h2>
<p>For cases where you have multiple spatial units, it is now possible
 to assign a specific tenure type for each spatial unit participating in
 a Social Tenure Relationship. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" title="" style="max-width: 624.00px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>Custom Tenure Information</h2>
<p>To add more flexibility to tenure information, STDM 1.7 adds a new feature
 that allows a user to add extra custom attributes to different tenure
 types when configuring a profile. An example of such custom attributes
 on tenure types would include added information on a disputed property
 ownership.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" title="" border="0" /></p>
<h1>Social Tenure Relationship Modules </h1>
<h2>Social Tenure Relationship (STR) Editor </h2>
<h3>Multiple Spatial Unit Entities </h3>
<p>With ability to choose more than one <strong>Spatial Units</strong>&#160;in
 the <strong>Configuration</strong>, the <strong>Social Tenure Relationship</strong>&#160;editor
 enables a user to switch between spatial units to select applicable spatial
 unit records. This can be applied in profiles which have more than one
 spatial unit such as parcel and structure, farm and house, etc. See the
 illustration below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" title="" style="max-width: 960px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h3>Custom Tenure Information</h3>
<p>The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> View Social Tenure Relationship</span>
 has benefited from an improved performance with code optimization to the
 search query and display. A <span style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Tenure
 Information</span> node also appears under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Social
 Tenure Relationship</span> item.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image8.png" title="" style="max-width: 960px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>View Social Tenure Relationship </h2>
<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">View Social Tenure Relationship</span>
 has benefited from an improved performance with internal changes to the
 search query and display. There is a noticeable change in querying speed
 but not a significant change in the result box as shown in the image below.
 </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image12.png" title="" style="max-width: 394px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h1>Spatial Unit Manager</h1>
<h2>QGIS Attribute Table and Styling STDM Layers </h2>
<p>A better integration is done with QGIS to style STDM layers using Lookup,
 Related Entity, and Administrative Unit columns. Previously these columns
 were showing ids of the parent table. By joining the parent tables to
 STDM layers, it is possible to show the values when in QGIS Attribute
 Table and under Layer Properties when styling layers as shown in the image
 below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" title="" style="max-width: 835px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>Spatial Entity Editor</h2>
<p>The GPS Importer is enabled by default to allow users to add and edit
 records from the Entity Browser. <span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 107%;
										 font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;
										 mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri;
										 mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US;
										 mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">This
 reduces complication for users as useres are no longer required to add
 a layer to add a new record.</span> Editing saved GPS feature is now possible
 which is very useful when a wrong feature is imported. Users can just
 edit a record and import the correct one to replace the geometry saved
 earlier&#160;(see the image below).</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image17.png" title="" style="max-width: 476.27px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h1>Document Designer</h1>
<h2>Sample Templates </h2>
<p>To make it easy for users to understand and design templates, new sample
 templates are incorporated. These templates can be customized in Documents
 Designer and used. Their names corresponds to the spatial units of each
 profiles. </p>
<p>The following templates are added into the template folder&#160;automatically:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Certificate of Structure Occupancy Sample</strong>&#160;-
	 Informal Settlement Profile</li>
	<li><strong>Certificate of Parcel Ownership Sample</strong>&#160;-
	 Local Government Profile</li>
	<li><strong>Certificate of Garden Occupancy Sample</strong>&#160;-
	 Rural Agriculture Profile</li>
</ul>
<h2>Saving a Document Template</h2>
<p>In the previous versions of STDM, clicking on the save button results
 in a dialog asking the user to write the file name even though a file
 name is provided in the previous save. In STDM 1.7, a dialog is no longer
 shown if the file is saved. Instead the changes are applied in the same
 file. </p>
<h2>Styling and Text Wrapping in Data Labels </h2>
<p>It is now possible to style and apply text wrapping on<strong>&#160;Data
 labels </strong>using HTML. To apply HTML, <strong>Render as HTML</strong>&#160;checkbox
 needs to be checked. Text wrapping is already possible in Attribute Table
 using the <strong>Appearance </strong>options under <strong>Item </strong>properties.
 &#160;</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg" title="" style="max-width: 408.50px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<p>The above code looks like the following on the generated document. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" title="" style="max-width: 317.50px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h2>Adding Text in Data Labels</h2>
<p>Users can now add text that acts as a label to the data label by adding
 it in front or after the data label. This reduces the number of items
 added to the template, which makes it easier to align, re-size, move items,
 etc. The image below shows example implementation. &#160; </p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image13.png" title="" style="max-width: 532.00px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h1>Document Generator</h1>
<p>An Open output Folder button has been added to enable users to open
 the output folder. See illustration below.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="images/image10.png" title="" style="max-width: 549px;"
        border="0" /></p>
<h1>General</h1>
<h2>Software Packages </h2>
<p>The all-in-one installer for STDM 1.7 is built upon the following packages:
 PostgreSQL v9.6, PostGIS 2.4 and QGIS 2.18. STDM is also compatible with
