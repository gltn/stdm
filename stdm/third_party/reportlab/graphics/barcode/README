Symbologies Currently Supported
===============================

The following have, at a minimum, been verified to scan with a WASP
CCD barcode scanner (found one bug in my code, two in the scanner!).
Some have had more extensive testing:

	Interleaved 2 of 5
	MSI
	Codabar
	Code 39 (Standard Character Set)
	Code 39 (Extended Character Set)
	Code 93 (Standard Character Set)
	Code 93 (Extended Character Set)
	Code 128 (Automatic use of A, B, C, with some optimizations -- 
		more coming)

The following have been tested by sending a fair number of mailpieces
with them:

	USPS FIM
	USPS POSTNET

The following have not been tested, as none of the scanners I have
access to support them:

	Code 11


Future Plans, Consulting
========================

Soon:

I plan to implement the following linear codes soon:

	UPC/EAN(/JAN)

The following are in progress, but I lack a way to verify them
(scanners I have access to don't read them), and I don't have complete
specs for the UK style.

	Royal Mail 4-State (UK/NL/etc style, and Australian style)

Down the road, I'd like to do some 2D symbologies. Likely first candidate
is PDF417. MaxiCode, Aztec Code, and some of the stacked symbologies are
also good candidates.

I am available to do implementation of additional symbologies for hire. 
Because I enjoy hacking barcodes, my rates for work in this particular
area are very low and are mainly to help offset costs associated with
obtaining related documents and/or to buy or gain access to scanning
equipment for symbologies if I don't already have a scanner that
supports them.  Loans of equipment are also accepted.
