See also README for some plans and info on consulting.

- Overall framework docs

- Finish Aussie Rules 4-State, for which I have complete docs now (yay
  USPS and aupost.com.au for putting specs online. Too bad UKPost doesn't.)

- Investigate USPS PLANET stuff

- Higher-level objects that handle barcoded address blocks with correct
  spacings and such (US, AU, UK/etc?)

- Even higher-level objects that represent mailpieces and place the
  above-style address block objects, FIM codes, "place stamp here" blocks,
  etc, correctly?

- Framework for laying out labels on various styles of n-up label
  sheets, like Avery labels, etc?

- Decide if Plessey is worth doing. MSI-like (MSI is actually derived from
  it), but specs were never formalized. Probably only useful for legacy
  applications. If you need it, mail me.

- Get someone to test Code 11, or find a scanner that handles it
